# GameCard Component Implementation

## What Was Changed

### ✅ Created New GameCard Component
**File:** `app/components/GameCard.tsx`

Features:
- Modern card design with hover effects
- Rating system (5 stars)
- Sale badge display
- Wishlist heart button (hover to show)
- "Get Game" button with icon
- Genre display
- Price with optional original price (strikethrough for sales)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Links to individual game pages

### ✅ Updated Home Page
**File:** `app/page.tsx`

Changes:
- Removed old card layout
- Integrated new GameCard component
- Connected to backend via `useGames()` hook
- Clean grid layout (responsive: 1-4 columns)
- Better loading/error/empty states
- Link to admin page when no games exist

### ✅ Navbar Already Configured
**File:** `app/Navbar.tsx`

- Logo (GC icon + "Game Core") links to home (`/`)
- "Store" link also goes to home (`/`)
- All navigation working correctly

### ✅ Image Configuration
**File:** `next.config.ts`

- Enabled external image loading
- Allows any HTTPS/HTTP image URLs
- Required for game cover images

## How It Works

1. **Backend Connection:**
   - `useGames()` hook fetches from `/api/games`
   - Automatically shows loading state
   - Displays errors if API fails
   - Maps game data to GameCard components

2. **Game Data Flow:**
   ```
   Database → API Route → useGames Hook → GameCard Component
   ```

3. **Card Features:**
   - **Click card:** Navigate to game detail page
   - **Hover card:** Scale up + show wishlist button
   - **Star rating:** Shows 4/5 stars (hardcoded for now)
   - **Genre:** Shows game category from database
   - **Price:** Formatted from database price

## Testing

### To see your cards with data:
1. Add games via admin page: `/admin`
2. Include:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Price (e.g., 59.99)
   - Image URL (full URL like `https://...`)
   - Category (e.g., "Action", "RPG", "Adventure")

### Example Game Data:
```json
{
  "title": "Cyberpunk 2077",
  "description": "An open-world RPG set in Night City",
  "price": 59.99,
  "imageUrl": "https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/3013/cKZ4tKNFj9C00giTzYtH8PF1.png",
  "category": "RPG"
}
```

✅ Frontend game display  
✅ Navigation (logo → home, store → home)  
✅ Individual game pages (click card)  
✅ Responsive design
